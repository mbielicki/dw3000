 *  @brief   Double-sided two-way ranging (DS TWR) responder example code
 *
 *           This is a simple code example which acts as the responder in a DS TWR distance measurement exchange. This application waits for a "poll"
 *           message (recording the RX time-stamp of the poll) expected from the "DS TWR initiator" example code (companion to this application), and
 *           then sends a "response" message recording its TX time-stamp, after which it waits for a "final" message from the initiator to complete
 *           the exchange. The final message contains the remote initiator's time-stamps of poll TX, response RX and final TX. With this data and the
 *           local time-stamps, (of poll RX, response TX and final RX), this example application works out a value for the time-of-flight over-the-air
 *           and, thus, the estimated distance between the two devices, which it writes to the LCD.

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. The sum of the values is the TX to RX antenna delay, experimentally determined by a calibration process. Here we use a hard coded typical value
 *    but, in a real application, each device should have its own antenna delay properly calibrated to get the best possible precision when performing
 *    range measurements.
 * 2. The messages here are similar to those used in the DecaRanging ARM application (shipped with EVK1000 kit). They comply with the IEEE
 *    802.15.4 standard MAC data frame encoding and they are following the ISO/IEC:24730-62:2013 standard. The messages used are:
 *     - a poll message sent by the initiator to trigger the ranging exchange.
 *     - a response message sent by the responder allowing the initiator to go on with the process
 *     - a final message sent by the initiator to complete the exchange and provide all information needed by the responder to compute the
 *       time-of-flight (distance) estimate.
 *    The first 10 bytes of those frame are common and are composed of the following fields:
 *     - byte 0/1: frame control (0x8841 to indicate a data frame using 16-bit addressing).
 *     - byte 2: sequence number, incremented for each new frame.
 *     - byte 3/4: PAN ID (0xDECA).
 *     - byte 5/6: destination address, see NOTE 3 below.
 *     - byte 7/8: source address, see NOTE 3 below.
 *     - byte 9: function code (specific values to indicate which message it is in the ranging process).
 *    The remaining bytes are specific to each message as follows:
 *    Poll message:
 *     - no more data
 *    Response message:
 *     - byte 10: activity code (0x02 to tell the initiator to go on with the ranging exchange).
 *     - byte 11/12: activity parameter, not used for activity code 0x02.
 *    Final message:
 *     - byte 10 -> 13: poll message transmission timestamp.
 *     - byte 14 -> 17: response message reception timestamp.
 *     - byte 18 -> 21: final message transmission timestamp.
 *    All messages end with a 2-byte checksum automatically set by DW IC.
 * 3. Source and destination addresses are hard coded constants in this example to keep it simple but for a real product every device should have a
 *    unique ID. Here, 16-bit addressing is used to keep the messages as short as possible but, in an actual application, this should be done only
 *    after an exchange of specific messages used to define those short addresses for each device participating to the ranging exchange.
 * 4. Delays between frames have been chosen here to ensure proper synchronisation of transmission and reception of the frames between the initiator
 *    and the responder and to ensure a correct accuracy of the computed distance. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM Source Code Guide for more
 *    details about the timings involved in the ranging process.

 *
 * EXAMPLE 1: with SPI rate set to 18 MHz (default on this platform), and frame lengths of ~190 us, the delays can be set to:
 *            POLL_RX_TO_RESP_TX_DLY_UUS of 400uus, and RESP_RX_TO_FINAL_TX_DLY_UUS of 400uus (TXtoRX delays are set to 210uus)
 *            reducing the delays further can be achieved by using interrupt to handle the TX/RX events, or other code optimisations/faster SPI
 *
 * EXAMPLE 2: with SPI rate set to 4.5 MHz, and frame lengths of ~190 us, the delays can be set to:
 *            POLL_RX_TO_RESP_TX_DLY_UUS of 550uus, and RESP_RX_TO_FINAL_TX_DLY_UUS of 600uus (TXtoRX delays are set to 360 and 410 uus respectively)
 *
 * 5. This timeout is for complete reception of a frame, i.e. timeout duration must take into account the length of the expected frame. Here the value
 *    is arbitrary but chosen large enough to make sure that there is enough time to receive the complete final frame sent by the responder at the
 *    6.81 Mbps data rate used (around 220 us).
 * 6. The preamble timeout allows the receiver to stop listening in situations where preamble is not starting (which might be because the responder is
 *    out of range or did not receive the message to respond to). This saves the power waste of listening for a message that is not coming. We
 *    recommend a minimum preamble timeout of 5 PACs for short range applications and a larger value (e.g. in the range of 50% to 80% of the preamble
 *    length) for more challenging longer range, NLOS or noisy environments.
 * 7. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW IC OTP memory.
 * 8. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
 *    refer to DW IC User Manual for more details on "interrupts". It is also to be noted that STATUS register is 5 bytes long but, as the event we
 *    use are all in the first bytes of the register, we can use the simple dwt_read32bitreg() API call to access it instead of reading the whole 5
 *    bytes.
 * 9. Timestamps and delayed transmission time are both expressed in device time units so we just have to add the desired response delay to poll RX
 *    timestamp to get response transmission time. The delayed transmission time resolution is 512 device time units which means that the lower 9 bits
 *    of the obtained value must be zeroed. This also allows to encode the 40-bit value in a 32-bit words by shifting the all-zero lower 8 bits.
 * 10. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of the message as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *     automatically appended by the DW IC. This means that our variable could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *     work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
 * 11. When running this example on the DWK3000 platform with the POLL_RX_TO_RESP_TX_DLY response delay provided, the dwt_starttx() is always
 *     successful. However, in cases where the delay is too short (or something else interrupts the code flow), then the dwt_starttx() might be issued
 *     too late for the configured start time. The code below provides an example of how to handle this condition: In this case it abandons the
 *     ranging exchange and simply goes back to awaiting another poll message. If this error handling code was not here, a late dwt_starttx() would
 *     result in the code flow getting stuck waiting subsequent RX event that will will never come. The companion "initiator" example (ex_05a) should
 *     timeout from awaiting the "response" and proceed to send another poll in due course to initiate another ranging exchange.
 * 12. The high order byte of each 40-bit time-stamps is discarded here. This is acceptable as, on each device, those time-stamps are not separated by
 *     more than 2**32 device time units (which is around 67 ms) which means that the calculation of the round-trip delays can be handled by a 32-bit
 *     subtraction.
 * 13. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *     DW IC API Guide for more details on the DW IC driver functions.
 * 14. In this example, the DW IC is put into IDLE state after calling dwt_initialise(). This means that a fast SPI rate of up to 36 MHz can be used
 *     thereafter.
 * 15. Desired configuration by user may be different to the current programmed configuration. dwt_configure is called to set desired
 *     configuration.
